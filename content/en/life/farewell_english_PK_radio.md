I haven't listened to the English PK Radio for a month. Tonight , when I opened WeChat to read the public account subscriptions, I found a farewell letter from the English PK Radio. It turns out that the radio program had already bid farewell to everyone last month.

The English PK Radio has always been my main source of English learning since the day I became aware of it. It is reliable, dedicated, and good enough to be my only choice. It has many wonderful programs - phonetics, vocabulary, American colloquial speech, intensive reading, advanced translation, and my favorite series of "Friends" and "Modern Family."

I will always remember every episode's opening remark by Teacher Jingjing - "English PK Radio, let's learn together, dear audience, good (afternoon/evening) to everyone." As soon as this opening remark came, I knew that the exciting content was about to begin again. 

The teaching atmosphere of the English PK Station has always been pleasant, mainly relying on Teacher Jingjing's hosting skills. She has a pleasant voice, is considerate, good at grasping the rhythm, and cooperates well with various partners. While listening to the program, I often marveled at how Teacher Jingjing could respond so well. 

I remember when the "Learn American English with Friends" class started, Teacher Henry had just come from abroad and could speak Chinese but couldn't use idioms or understand popular phrases. Teacher Jingjing promptly assisted and supported him. A few years have passed, and "Learn American English with Friends" has come out with its third book. Last year, I heard Teacher Henry's class again and found that his Chinese has become very fluent. 

The appropriate familiarity that Teacher Jingjing and her partners presented was something I only realized after I started working - such an atmosphere among colleagues is hard to come by.

Thank you to Radio Beijing International for once considering English education an important mission and persisting to this day- it has been fifteen years, benefiting countless listeners. The current international and domestic environments are very complex, with increasing conflicts between countries, cultures, and concepts, and fewer and fewer people are guarding their original intentions. What we can do is not to be blinded by the media, to go out and walk more, and to communicate and interact more. 

I hope all the teachers have a bright future. As one of your listeners, I will continue to learn English, use English for input and output more, and thank you for your company over the years.
