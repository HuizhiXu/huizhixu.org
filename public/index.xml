      <description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t listened to the English PK Radio for a month. Tonight , when I opened WeChat to read the public account subscriptions, I found a farewell letter from the English PK Radio. It turns out that the radio program had already bid farewell to everyone last month.
The English PK Radio has always been my main source of English learning since the day I became aware of it. It is reliable, dedicated, and good enough to be my only choice.</description>
